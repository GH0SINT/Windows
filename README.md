  Classic Windows .bat helpers (zero‑dependency).
  See the full README in scripts/batch/README.md for script descriptions, usage, and contribution notes.

  3️⃣ PowerShell (scripts/powershell/README.md)

  5️⃣ License

  Each individual script should retain its copyright header.

  6️⃣ Contributing
  Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
  Follow the language‑specific style guidelines found in each sub‑folder’s README.
  Keep scripts idempotent and self‑contained.
  When you add a new script, update the appropriate sub‑folder README (and optionally this master README if you add a new language folder).
Open a Pull Request with a clear description of the changes.
Tip: If you introduce a completely new language/toolset, copy the structure of this master README (table of contents → sub‑folder sections) so the repository stays easy to navigate.
